Build a collaborative document editor following these guidelines:

Architecture:
- Separate concerns between frontend and backend
- Use React for UI components
- Keep database logic separate from business logic
- Follow RESTful API design where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling and validation

Code Quality:
- Functions should do one thing
- Keep files under 300 lines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Avoid global variables
- Handle async operations properly

Security:
- Validate user input
- Don't expose sensitive data in responses
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication

Performance:
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Minimize API calls from the frontend

Please ensure the code is production-ready and maintainable.
